We have used the textrank algorithm for summarizing the nepali finacial text articles for our project which is customed to give
output sentences as summary output.

TEXTRANK: The extractive summarization technique which is graph based ranking model used for natural language processing(NLP)
tasks like text summarization and keyword extraction. Also it is inspired by the google's pagerank algorithm.

NODES AND EDGES: In TextRank, each word or sentence is represented as a node in a graph. 
Edges are created between nodes based on the relationships between words or sentences, often determined by content overlap. 
For sentences, edges are established if they share common words, while for keywords, connections are made based 
on co-occurrence within a specified window of text.

RANKING MECHANISM
Iterative mechanism: The algorithm employs an iterative process similar to PageRank. Each node's score is updated based 
on the scores of its connected nodes. This means that words or sentences that are linked to other high-scoring nodes will
 receive higher scores themselves. The process continues until the scores stabilize, yielding a final ranking of the
 nodes.

ADVANTAGES
Unsupervised Learning: TextRank does not require labeled training data or deep linguistic knowledge, making it applicable 
across different languages and domains25.
Semantic Understanding: Unlike traditional methods like TF-IDF that rely solely on frequency counts, TextRank captures 
semantic relationships between words, leading to more meaningful keyword extraction and summarization.
